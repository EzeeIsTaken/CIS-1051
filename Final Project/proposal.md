# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Pokedex - The Temple University Region
<br>
Interactive Turtle Aim Trainer

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A pokedex based off of Temple teachers showing their rate my professor and temple portal information.
<br>
An interactive turtle that acts as an aim trainer and increases in difficulty the better you do.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

For the aim trainer we hope to have multiple levels. With the interative turtle, the faster you click the shape then the more complex the shape gets and the faster the turtle will move.
<br>
If we do the pokedex instead, then we hope to have the pokedex show a decent amount of teachers from different subjects, and that teachers: picture, strenghts, weaknesses, name, college they teach, email, and office hours. We would pull information from rate my professor and temples portal.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

Not applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Interactive Turtle Aim Trainer: Atleast have a interactive turtle that appears and disappears
<br>
Pokedex - The Temple University Region: Atleast have a interface of menus to interact with

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Interactive Turtle Aim Trainer: Have multiple difficults and accuracy percentage
<br>
Pokedex: Have some teacher's information manually imported

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Interactive Turtle Aim Trainer: Polished animations, some graphics, score history, and maybe sound.
<br>
Pokedex: Have data from rate my professor automatically imported into our pokedex, things such as ratings, written reviews, and tags such as tough grader or note heavy.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Interactive Turtle Aim Trainer: For this project a skill I need to learn is making turtle interactive so that we can record the user's input. As I have to understand turtle therefore I'll need to do some research and learn more about turtle's capabilities. For working with a partner I was thinking maybe we can both do the steps together so one doesn't feel burned out and we would be able to help each other on parts we maybe not understand and lettign us find our strengths and weaknesses.
<br>
Pokedex: For this project a skill I need to learn is understanding how to code in swift. As the template of the pokedex is going to be a mobile app on ios. A topic I need to research is how to code for mobile apps. Another thing I need to research is how to automatically transfer data from rate my professor into the pokedex app. As partners in this project, one would focus on learning to code in swift to create the basic menu while the other learns how APIs work and try to import some data.
