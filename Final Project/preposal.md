# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

1. Turtle Aim Trainer, stamp turtle randomly and use clicks to score a point. (Includes acurracy and multiple difficulty levels)
2. Pokedex of Temple Teachers, sort of like a rate my professor in a form of a pokedex.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?
Antonio Fabrizio

## Do you have any questions of your own?
1. How do we make turtle interactive so that the user can click on the stamped turtle and store it as a value?
